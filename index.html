            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shashank, just another AI scientist. Currently, I'm playing with robots and algorithms at <a href="https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us.html">Rockwell Automation</a> in Austin, TX. Think of me as the guy who's trying to teach machines to see and think â€“ without the apocalyptic outcomes!</p>
                    <p>My journey in the world of AI has been quite the rollercoaster. I've dabbled in everything from making self-driving cars less confused at <a href="#">Uber Lab</a> to helping computers understand images better than your average Instagram influencer at <a href="https://www.kla.com/">KLA Tencor</a>. Oh, and I spent some time at <a href="#">MathWorks Inc</a> convincing MATLAB that it's cool to be used for more than just homework.</p>
                    <p>I sharpened my skills at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>, where I got my Master's in Computer Vision (yes, I can officially say I've trained computers to appreciate art). Before that, I was shocking circuits and coding simultaneously at <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India</a>.</p>
                    <!--<p>When I'm not trying to make AI less artificial and more intelligent, you can find me geeking out over the latest tech gadgets, attempting to explain machine learning concepts to my houseplants, or trying to convince my smart home devices to get along. Let's just say, I'm on a mission to make AI so user-friendly, even your grandma could use it (and maybe she already is)!</p> -->
                    <p> Oh, and I play Tennis. Although lately, I've been accidently evangelizing pickleball to all my tennis buddies. I swear, I was just trying to explain neural network using pickle analogy, and somehow we ended up with paddles in hand. But let's be real, I love Rafa way too much to ever betray tennis. My loyalty to Rafa is as strong as my belief that one day, AI will learn to appreciate a good topspin forehand. Until then, I'll keep my rallies on the tennis court and my pickle references strictly in the kitchen, where they belong!</p>
